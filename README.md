# The Harness
"The Harness" was my custom-designed micromouse built to compete in the 2025 All-American Micromouse Competition (AAMC). It placed 3rd overall with a completion time of 21.639 seconds.

> [!NOTE]
> This design is a lot more compact and sleak than my initial design which competed in the 2024 AAMC and placed 5th overall with a completion time of 83.438 seconds.

All of the PCB design files can be found in "mouse_schematic.zip" and all of the relevant-software can be found in the "Core" folder.

## Schematic
The schematic was made in KiCad 8.0.
